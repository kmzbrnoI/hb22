DCC signal booster

## Features

* Input voltage: track+1V – 35 V **DC**
* Output voltage: 14–25 V DCC
* Maximum output current: 3 A
* Adjustable output voltage
* Stepdown for stabilization (energy-effective)
* No big cooler needed
* Analog current limitation to 3 A
* DCC skew rate limitation
* RailCom support
* Possibility to connect expansion module for integration with railroad-control system
* Current sensing, voltage sensing, temperature sensing
* Short-circuit detection, (configurable) automatic restore after short-circuit

## Available expansion modules

- [MTBbus expansion module](exp-mtb)

## Principles

Main MCU does all safety-critical operations:

* Detection of short-circuit
* Railcom pause insertion
